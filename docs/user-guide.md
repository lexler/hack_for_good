# Behavioral Tracking App - User Guide

## Overview
This app is designed for clinicians and therapists to track behavioral observations during parent-child therapy sessions and behavioral assessments. The app captures exactly 5 minutes of behavioral data across 8 different categories.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the App
- **Online**: Visit [lexler.github.io/hack_for_good](https://lexler.github.io/hack_for_good/)
- **Mobile-friendly**: The app works on tablets, phones, and computers
- **No installation required**: Runs directly in your web browser

## How to Use the App

### 1. Starting an Observation Session
- The app displays 8 behavioral category buttons and a timer showing **5:00**
- **The timer starts automatically** when you tap the first behavioral category button
- Once started, you have exactly 5 minutes to complete your observation

### 2. Recording Behaviors
**Touch/Tap Method:**
- Simply tap any of the 8 category buttons (TA, BD, RF, LP, UP, QU, CM, NTA) to record an occurrence
- Each tap increases the count for that category
- The current count is displayed on each button

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
You can use your keyboard instead of tapping:

**Number Pad Layout:**
```
7 = TA    8 = BD    9 = RF
4 = LP    5 = UNDO  6 = UP  
1 = QU    2 = CM    3 = NTA
```

**QWERTY Layout (Alternative):**
```
Q = TA    W = BD    E = RF
A = LP    S = UNDO  D = UP
Z = QU    X = CM    C = NTA
```

### 3. Timer Functionality
- **5-minute countdown**: Timer shows remaining time (e.g., 4:32, 3:15, etc.)
- **Automatic stop**: When timer reaches 0:00, all buttons are automatically disabled
- **No data entry after timeout**: You cannot record behaviors once the timer expires
- **Timer turns red**: When expired, the timer display changes color to indicate the session is complete

### 4. Correcting Mistakes

**Undo Last Action:**
- **Touch**: Tap the undo button (↩️) in the center of the button grid
- **Keyboard**: Press **5** on number pad or **S** on QWERTY
- This removes the most recent behavioral count you recorded

**Settings Menu:**
Tap the **⚙️ Settings** button to access additional options:
- **Return**: Go back to the main counting screen
- **Cancel Evaluation**: Reset all counts to zero and restart
- **Finish Evaluation**: Complete the session and view results

### 5. Viewing and Emailing Results

**After the 5-minute timer expires OR when you click "Finish Evaluation":**

1. **Results Summary**: A summary screen shows the count for each behavioral category
2. **Automatic Clipboard Copy**: Results are automatically copied to your device's clipboard
3. **Paste to Spreadsheet**: You can immediately paste (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V) the results into Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application
4. **Email Results**: Click this button to send results to the Kempe Center
5. **Email Process**:
   - Your default email application (Outlook, Gmail, etc.) will open automatically
   - The email is pre-addressed to the Kempe Center
   - Results from your 5-minute observation are included in the email body
   - Simply click "Send" in your email application

**Important**: Make sure you have a default email application set up on your device before using the email feature.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Before Starting
- ✅ Ensure you have 5 uninterrupted minutes for observation
- ✅ Position yourself where you can clearly observe the parent-child interaction
- ✅ Have the app ready on your device before beginning the session

### During Observation
- ✅ Use keyboard shortcuts for faster data entry if comfortable
- ✅ Focus on accurate, real-time recording rather than trying to "catch up"
- ✅ Remember: you cannot add data after the 5-minute timer expires

### After Observation
- ✅ Review your results before emailing
- ✅ Ensure your email was sent successfully to the Kempe Center
- ✅ Use "Cancel Evaluation" if you need to start over completely

## Troubleshooting

**Timer not starting?**
- Make sure you tap a behavioral category button (not the settings or undo button)

**Email not opening?**
- Check that you have a default email application set up on your device
- Try refreshing the page and attempting the email process again

**Accidentally reset your data?**
- Unfortunately, there's no way to recover data after using "Cancel Evaluation"
- You'll need to start a new 5-minute observation session

**App not responding?**
- Refresh your web browser page
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection

## Technical Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Internet connection (for initial loading)
- Default email application configured on your device
