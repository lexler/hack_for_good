# Plan: Add Clipboard Copy Functionality to Finish Session Button

## Overview
Add functionality that copies all session data to the clipboard when the finish session button is pressed in the behavioral observation app.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create a comprehensive data generation method
- Add a new method `generateSessionData()` that compiles all session information including:
  - Timestamp of session completion
  - Session duration
  - All behavioral counts with their labels
  - Total actions recorded
  - Question answers (homework/questionnaire) if available
  - App version

### 2. Create clipboard copy method
- Add a new method `copySessionDataToClipboard()` that:
  - Uses the modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API
  - Includes error handling with fallback to alert dialog
  - Provides visual feedback by temporarily changing the finish button text to "Copied!" with green background
  - Resets button appearance after 2 seconds

### 3. Modify the finish evaluation flow
- Update the `finishEvaluation()` method to call the clipboard copy function before showing results
- This ensures data is copied immediately when the finish button is pressed



### 5. Test the implementation
- Verify clipboard functionality works in modern browsers
- Test the fallback behavior for browsers that don't support clipboard API
- Confirm visual feedback works properly

## Expected Outcome
When users press the finish session button, all session data will be automatically copied to their clipboard, making it easy to paste the data elsewhere for record-keeping or analysis. The button will provide visual confirmation that the copy operation was successful.

## Technical Notes
- Uses modern Clipboard API for better security and user experience
- Includes graceful fallback for older browsers
- Maintains existing functionality while adding the new clipboard feature
- Provides clear user feedback for the copy operation
